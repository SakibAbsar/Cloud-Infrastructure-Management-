# Multi-Cloud Infrastructure Deployment and Management System

## Overview
This project simulates a multi-cloud infrastructure management solution, deploying and managing resources on both AWS and Azure. It includes IaC setup, monitoring, security configurations, cost management, and automation.

## Structure
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform files to set up AWS and Azure resources.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for cost management, monitoring, and backup automation.
- **CI/CD**: Pipeline configurations for automated deployments.
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch and Azure Log Analytics configurations.
- **Docs**: Documentation for infrastructure design, security, and cost optimization.

## Setup
1. Configure cloud credentials in `aws_config.yaml` and `azure_config.yaml`.
2. Deploy infrastructure with Terraform files in `infrastructure/`.
3. Set up pipelines using the configurations in `ci_cd/`.
4. Run management scripts in `scripts/` for monitoring and cost optimization.
